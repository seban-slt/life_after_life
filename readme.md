# life after life

This is my entry for **Silly Venture 2025, Summer Edition**.
It took **7th place** in the 256-byte intro compo for Atari XL/XE.

The intro implements a complete version of **Conway’s Game of Life**, fully packed into just **256 bytes**.
This repository contains the full source code with comments.

## Compilation
To build the intro, use **XASM**.
